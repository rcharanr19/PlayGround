As implemented, this template leverages the batch module.

The batch job is divided in *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

The integration is triggered by a scheduler or ondemand url defined in the flow that triggers the application.

During the *Process* stage, each Salesforce user is filtered depending on if it has an existing matching user in the Database.
The last step of the *Process* stage groups the users and inserts or updates them in Database.

Finally during the *On Complete* stage the template logs output statistics data into the console.
